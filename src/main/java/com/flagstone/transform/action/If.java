/**
 * The If action is used to perform a conditional branch to control the actions
 * executed by the Flash Player.
 *
 * <p>
 * When executed, the If action pops a value from the stack and evaluates it to
 * see whether it evaluates as true or false. If the boolean value is true the
 * offset attribute of the If action is added to the Flash Player's instruction
 * pointer and execution of the stream of actions continues from that location.
 * If the boolean value is false then no branch is taken.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the Flash Player contains an instruction pointer it does not support
 * an explicit address space. The instruction pointer is used to reference
 * actions within the current stream of actions being executed whether they are
 * associated with a given frame, button or movie clip. The value contained in
 * the instruction pointer is the address relative to the start of the current
 * stream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The offset is a signed number, allowing branches up to -32768 to 32767 bytes.
 * The instruction pointer points to the next instruction in the stream of
 * actions being executed so specifying an offset of zero will have no effect on
 * the sequence of instructions executed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the value popped off the stack is a number it is evaluated as true if it
 * is non-zero. If the value is a string it is evaluated to true if it is not an
 * empty string ("") or the strings "0" or "false".
 * </p>
