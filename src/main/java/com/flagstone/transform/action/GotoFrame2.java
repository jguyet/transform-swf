/**
 * The GotoFrame2 action instructs the player to go to the named or numbered
 * frame in the current movie's main time-line. It extends the functionality
 * provided by the GotoFrame action by allowing the name of a frame, previously
 * assigned using the FrameLabel object, to be specified.
 *
 * <p>
 * Up to Flash Version 4, movies contained a single sequence of 65536 frames. In
 * Flash 5 the concept of Scenes was added which allowed movies to contain
 * 'pages' of frames. GotoFrame2 contains a frameOffset attribute which allows
 * the frames in each scene to be referenced by its 'logical' number. The
 * frameOffset for a given scene is added to the frame number to generate the
 * 'physical' page number.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * GotoFrame2 is a stack-based action. The name or number of the frame is pushed
 * onto the stack before the GotoFrame2 action is executed. If a frameOffset is
 * specified it is added to the number of the frame identified by the stack
 * arguments to give the final frame number. Whether the movie starts playing
 * the frame is controlled by the boolean attribute, <i>play</i>. When set to
 * true the movie starts playing the frame as soon as it has been loaded by the
 * Flash Player.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * GotoFrame2 is only used to control the main time-line of a movie. Controlling
 * how an individual movie clip is played is handled by a different mechanism.
 * From Flash 5 onward movie clips are defined as objects. The ExecuteMethod
 * action is used to execute the gotoAndPlay() or gotoAndStop() methods that
 * control a movie clip's time-line.
 * </p>
