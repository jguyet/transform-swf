/**
 * BasicAction represents all the actions that can be encoded using a single
 * byte-code.
 *
 * Where appropriate the description for an action contains a simple example
 * showing the order of arguments on the stack and any result: e.g. 3, 2 -> 1.
 * Here 3 and 2 are the numbers on the stack with 2 being the top-most. When the
 * action is executed the numbers are popped off and the result to the right of
 * the arrow is the result is pushed onto the stack.
 *
 * <h1>Notes:</h1>
 * <p>
 * FSPush is used to push literals onto the Stack. See also FSRegisterCopy which
 * copies the value on top of the Stack to one of the Flash Player's internal
 * registers.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Arithmetic add is supported by two actions. INTEGER_ADD was introduced in
 * Flash 4. It was replaced in Flash 5 by the more flexible ADD action which is
 * able to add any two numbers and also concatenate strings. If a string and a
 * number are added then the number is converted to its string representation
 * before concatenation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For comparison, Flash 4 introduced INTEGER_LESS and INTEGER_EQUALS for
 * comparing numbers and STRING_LESS and STRING_EQUALS for comparing strings.
 * They were superseded in Flash 5 by LESS and EQUALS which work with either
 * strings or numbers.
 * </p>
