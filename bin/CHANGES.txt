  Bug Fixes
-------------

1. ScreenPacket no longer throws exception in constructor.
 
   The constructor was not creating the array used to store ImageBlock objects
   so a NullPointerException would be thrown. 

2. ScreenPacket no longer mixes up width and height on ImageBlocks.

   The constructor used to decode a ScreenPacket from a block of data got the 
   order for the width and height of the decoded ImageBlock object reversed.
   
3. ConvolutionFilter now compares matrices correctly.

   In the equals() method the comparison of the matrices that contain the 
   convolution parameters was using simple object identity rather than 
   Arrays.deepEqual().
   
4. ConvolutionFilter now implements hashCode() correctly.

   The hashCode() method simply called hashCode() on the matrix that stored the
   convolution parameters. This has now been changed to Arrays.deepHashCode().
   
5. ConvolutionFilter toString() is not correctly formatted.

   The toString() method simply calls toString() on the matrix that stores
   the convolution parameters. This returns only the object identity and not a 
   formatted string containing all the array parameters.
   
6. DefineTextField toString() now returns the correct description of the object.

   A StringBuilder was used to create the (lengthy) description of the object
   but it was not used to return the string. Instead String.format() was used
   but the format string was empty.
   
7. FontFace now comparing names correctly.

   In the equals() method the name attribute of the current object was being 
   compared with itself rather than with the target object.
   
8. DefineFont4 correctly decodes bold and italic fields.

   The constructor that decodes DefineFont4 objects did not correctly apply bit 
   masks for the fields that identify whether a font contains bold face or 
   italicised glyphs.
   
9. BMPDecoder.getImage() now returns true colour pixels for indexed images.

   The getImage() method simply returned a copy of the image array. For indexed
   images the array contained only the indices into the table rather than true 
   colour pixels.
    
10. PNGDecoder.getImage() now returns true colour pixels for indexed images.

   The getImage() method simply returned a copy of the image array. For indexed
   images the array contained only the indices into the table rather than true 
   colour pixels.
   
11. Gradient.equals() now compares object with correct class.

   The equals() method was checking the object was a Kerning instead of a 
   Gradient.
   
12. GlyphIndex.equals() now compares object with correct class.

   The equals() method was checking the object was a Bounds instead of a 
   GlyphIndex.
   
13. IllegalArgumentValueException.toString() formats values array correctly.

   The toString() method simply called toString() on the array of values instead
   of using Arrays.toString() to correctly format the string.
   
14. SWFFontDecoder no longer throws ClassCastException.

   DefineFont2 objects were incorrectly cast as DefineFont objects resulting in
   a ClassCastException being thrown.
